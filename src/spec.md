# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebuild the application from the provided HTML source code, preserving all sections, styling, interactions, and the cute, friendly aesthetic with Comic Sans MS font and pink gradient background.

**Planned changes:**
- Parse and implement all sections, components, and navigation from the HTML source as React components
- Apply Comic Sans MS font family throughout the app with cursive fallback
- Implement the exact gradient background (linear gradient from #ffc0cb to #ff99cc, top-left to bottom-right)
- Convert HTML/CSS styling patterns to Tailwind classes or custom CSS matching the original design
- Implement section display logic where only one section shows at a time with consistent 50px vertical and 20px horizontal padding
- Convert all JavaScript functionality from the HTML to React hooks and components
- Preserve all buttons, inputs, interactive elements, content sections, and event handlers from the complete HTML source

**User-visible outcome:** The application will match the look, feel, and functionality of the original HTML app, with a pink gradient background, Comic Sans MS font, and all interactive features working as designed in the source code.
