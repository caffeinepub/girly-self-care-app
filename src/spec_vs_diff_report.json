REQ-10 ambient music is implemented with the exact URL, visible play/pause + mute controls, localStorage persistence, and autoplay failure handling. REQ-11 (copy matching provided HTML wording/labels/placeholders) is only partially met: several labels/placeholders/instructions differ from the specified/expected wording (e.g., Menu button labels and placeholders), and additional emoji-styled copy was introduced.",
